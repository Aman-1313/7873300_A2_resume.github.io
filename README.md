# HOST A RESUME ONLINE. 
## Purpose: 
Host a portfoilio or a resume online using static site generator and a distributed version control. The following instructions aim to provide simple yet practical steps to host and format a resume online.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A Markdown formatted Resume
- A Github account

## Instructions
### Key Principles:
Inspired by  _Andrew Etterâ€™s_ *Modern Technical Writing*, here are some _Key Principles_ for hosting a great static website or a _Resume_:
#### 1. Use a lightweight markup language: 
- Traditional languages used to write a website content like XML and HTML can be very time consuming and difficult to learn because of their specialized tags and sytax.
-  A lightweight markup language like **Markdown** provide a human readable syntax and is easily converted into HTML, which makes it easier for technical writers to contribute content to an online website.

HTML code 
```HTML
<h1 id="my-resume">My Resume</h1>
<h2 id="experience-">Experience:</h2>
<ul>
<li>first job</li>
<li>second job</li>
<li>third job </li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Aman-1313/Aman-1313.github.io/">https://github.com/Aman-1313/Aman-1313.github.io/</a></p>
```
Markdown code 
```
# My Resume
## Experience:
- first job
- second job
- third job 

<https://github.com/Aman-1313/Aman-1313.github.io/>
```
Both of the code-blocks above provide the exact same result but Markdown is clearly more *Readable* and *Efficient* compared to HTML. This difference becomes even more evident when working on large projects.

#### 2. Format a document with a static site generator:
- Static sites are a fast, simple, and secure source of creating technical documention. 
- Using Lightweight Markup *Content* and a *Theme*(HTML, CSS) __static site generators__ can help add complex functionalities to our documentation website. 
#### 3. Host documents on a Distributed Version Control System:
-  Distributed Version Control Systems can be used to host static websites.

### Practical Steps:
Now that we have talked about key principles of hosting a static website, it is time to learn the practical steps to host an online Resume.
These steps include:

## FAQs
1. Why is Markdown better than a word processor?
>  Markdown was created primarily to format information that is to be published online. Unlike traditional word processors, Markdown files can easily be coverted into HTML to be published online.
2. Why is my resume not showing up?
>  A newly deployed Github hosted website can possibly take up to 30 minutes to go online. If your resume does not show up at first, check back after few minutes to see your changes.
