## FAQs
1. Why is Markdown better than a word processor?
>  Markdown was created primarily to format information that is to be published online. Unlike traditional word processors, Markdown files can easily be coverted into HTML to be published online.
2. Why is my resume not showing up?
>  A newly deployed Github hosted website can possibly take up to 30 minutes to go online. If your resume does not show up at first, check back after few minutes to see your changes.
